# Spacestagram

This is my submission for the Shopify frontend challenge. It uses NASA's publically-available [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://api.nasa.gov#apod) API to display a gallery of pictures dating back 30 days.

## Features

- Display 30-days' worth of pictures
- **Persistent** liking and unliking of photos -- it will stay across the same session
- A very cool loader that is near and dear to me
- The ability to share the link to you favorite image!

## Live Demo

The live demo for this project is [here](https://spacestagram.nadeen.tech/).

## Running locally

To build this project locally, clone the repository, run `npm install`, then `npm start`.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
